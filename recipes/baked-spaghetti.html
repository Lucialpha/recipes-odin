    <p>This recipe is quick an easy to make</p>

    <p>ingredients</p>
    <P>    1 lb. ground beef, browned and drained of fat
        1 lb. cooked and drained spaghetti noodles
        1 quart jar Kitchen Kettle Original Marinara Sauce
        8 slices American Cheese
        1 - 1 1/2 c. grated Cheddar Cheese
        Parmesan Cheese
        Italian Seasoning</P>

        <p>Combine sauce and cooked ground beef in a bowl and set aside for layering. Place cooked spaghetti in a bowl so it is also ready for layering. Gather remaining ingredients and prepare a 2 qt. casserole dish by greasing bottom and sides.

            In greased 2 quart casserole, layer in the following order:
            1. half of cooked spaghetti noodles.
            2. Sprinkle to taste with Italian seasonings.
            3. Place 4 slices of American cheese on top
            4. Place 1/2 - 3/4 c. Cheddar cheese over top of American.
            5. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
            6. Place half of meat sauce on top of cheese.
            7. Repeat.
            Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until bubbly.
            
            This freezes very well. Remove from freezer and thaw completely before baking. Add an additional 15 minutes to the baking time to reheat casserole thoroughly.
            
            A tip for preparation:
            Buy twice the ingredients that you need. Prepare twice the amount of meat sauce and spaghetti noodles. Make sure you keep the noodles separate from the sauce. Youâ€™ll have 2 meals for the work of 1!
